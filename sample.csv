The young male sea lion was rescued in January at La Jolla Cove. Upon examinations and x-rays, the veterinarian team discovered that the sea lion pup had ingested over 50-100 rocks that would need to be removed for him to recover. He was scoped by a team of trained veterinarians five times, and over a pound and a half of rocks were successfully removed from his stomach. Once healthy, he doubled in weight and was ready for return.‚Äã

The yearling Northern elephant seal was rescued from Imperial Beach with multiple cookie cutter shark bite wounds. She was brought to SeaWorld San Diego where her wounds were treated until they healed properly. Once she maintained a healthy weight and had fully healed, she was ready for return.‚Äã
